ways to initialization.
1.string s = string("xxx");
typically initialized way.
when going out of the scope, it will be deleted automatically.
2.string * s = new string("xxx");
bad way.new string return string pointer, and need to delete it after using it.
3.string s = "xxx";
same effect as the #1, but need the convert constructor and non-explicit.
4.string s("xxx");
same effect as the #1, but need the constructor with the self-instance argument(ie, A(const& A a)).
